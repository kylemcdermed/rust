// Constants are variables that are bond to a name and are not allowed to change 
//
// few difference between constants and variables 
//
// you are allowed to use mut with constants 
// consts arent just immutable by default -- theyre always immutable 
//
// here is a example of const declaration
// const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
//
// Rust has a naming convention for constants to use all UPPERCASE with _UNDER_SCORES_ in between
// words 
//
