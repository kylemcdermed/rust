// FUNCTIONS 
//
// the most important function in the Rust language is the `main` function, which is the entry
// point of many programs
//
// youve aso seen the `fn` keyword, which allows you to declare a new function
//
// Rust uses snake_case as the convential style for function and variable names, all letters are
// lower case and underscores separate words
