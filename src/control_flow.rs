// CONTROL FLOW
//
// the most common constructs that let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are if
// expressions and loops
//
//
// IF EXPRESSIONS
//
// an if expression allows you to branch your code depending on conditions, you provide a condition
// and then state, if this condition is met, run this block of code, if the condition is not met,
// do not run this block of code
